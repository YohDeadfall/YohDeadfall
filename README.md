# Hey there!

My name is Yoh, and I'm an experienced Software Engineer who likes to be nerd-sniped on performance and API design topics.

## Highlights

* Rust Annual Survey translator to Russian.
* Co-maintainer of [Npgsql](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql) from 2017 to 2021.

* Implemented support for fields and nullable types in `System.Text.Json`.
